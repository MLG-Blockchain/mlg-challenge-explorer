# MLG Blockchain Development Challenge
Applicants for the [Blockchain developer] role at MLG (mlgblockchain.com) must complete the following challenge, and submit a solution prior to the interview. 

There isn't a hard deadline for this exercise; take as long as you need to complete it. However, in terms of total time spent actively working on the challenge, we ask that you not spend more than a few hours, as we value your time and are happy to leave things open to discussion.

Please use whatever programming language and framework you feel the most comfortable with.

Feel free to email [hello@mlgblockchain.com](hello@mlgblockchain.com) if you have any questions.

## Project Description
Imagine that MLG has a new client that would like to convert their traditional database and business logic to a private Ethereum blockchain. We need to create a private blockchain on Ethereum blockchain for the client that other nodes can attach to. Your challenge is to create a user interface that can send tokens and stores the transactions in a chain explorer. You are welcome to use any open source code.

### What your web-based application must do:

Your app must be able to send a transaction that is stored in a blockchain explorer. Information that must be stored on-chain includes:
  - timestamp
  - block height
  - sender and receiver address
  - transaction amount

Another party must be able to attach to your chain. Your application should be easy to set up, and should run on either Linux or Mac OS X.

There are many ways that this application could be built; we ask that you build it in a way that showcases one of your strengths. If you you enjoy front-end development, do something interesting with the interface. If you prefer backend development or api design, feel free to create a simple api to integrate with your app. We're happy to tweak the requirements slightly if it helps you show off one of your strengths.

### Documentation:

Please modify `README.md` to add:

1. Instructions on how to build/run your application
1. A paragraph or two about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why.

## Submission Instructions

1. Fork this project on github. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one.
1. Complete the project as described below within your fork.
1. Push all of your changes to your fork on github and submit a pull request. 
1. You should also email [hello@mlgblockchain.com](hello@mlgblockchain.com) and your recruiter to let them know you have submitted a solution. Make sure to include your github username in your email (so we can match applicants with pull requests.)

## Alternate Submission Instructions (if you don't want to publicize completing the challenge)
1. Clone the repository.
1. Complete your project as described below within your local repository.
1. Email a patch file to [hello@mlgblockchain.com](hello@mlgblockchain.com)

## Evaluation
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. 

1. Did you follow the instructions for submission? 
1. Did you document your build/deploy instructions and your explanation of what you did well?
1. Were components easily identifiable to the reviewer? 
1. What design decisions did you make? Why (i.e. were they explained?)
1. Did you separate any concerns in your application? Why or why not?
